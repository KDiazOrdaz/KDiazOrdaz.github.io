I am a Royal Society- Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Dale Fellow (2020-2025).\nMy research explores the potential of statistical machine learning in combination with causal inference methodology to assist in the medical and policy decisions. I oversee a small research group based at the Alan Turing Institute.\nOur work currently focuses on optimal policy learning (i.e. optimal treatment regimens), treatment effect heterogeneity and counterfactual prediction. This includes theoretical developments, novel methodology, and applied data science in policy evaluation, pharmaco-epidemiology and clinical trials."

    "text": "On locality of local explanation models Paper link\nDate: 2021\nAuthors: Ghalebikesabi S, Ter-Minassian L, DiazOrdaz K, & Holmes C.\nexcerpt: Shapley values provide model agnostic feature attributions for black-box models under a global population distribution. The use of a global population can be misleading when we are interested in local model behaviour. Hence we propose the use of neighbourhood reference distributions that improve the local interpretability."

I am particularly interested in orthogonalised estimators (exploiting influence-functions).\nI am also co-lead in a collaborative research project “Developing statistical machine learning methods for Clinical Trials” based at the Alan Turing Institute. We are building machine learning models to predict trial site risk of under-performing (in the sense of low quality data, high rate of missing data or higher than expected adverse events, for example).\nI am interested in studying fairness and explainability of prediction models and heterogeneous treatments effects (through the lens of causal inference)."
